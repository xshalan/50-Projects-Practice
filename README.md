# Overview
A try to refresh and practice daily `CSS` and `Javascript`. All projects here based on Udemy course [50 Projects In 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/)

The projects are considered as mini-projects which develop some of the most features we see over the web. Even if the course is easy and most projects can be completed in less than hour, I gain a lot of knowledge. 
## Future Projects
I'll do my best to hit the 100th project as a daily practice. Just keep this here as a reminder.
